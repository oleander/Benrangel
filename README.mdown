What is Benrangel?
==================
Benrangel is a Rails v3 application skeleton, pre-filled with gems and common functionality used throughout many of my projects.

How to use
----------
1. Clone: `git clone -o benrangel git://github.com/Burgestrand/Benrangel.git`
2. Install dependencies: `bundle install`
3. Rename: `rake app:rename NAME=newname`
4. You are done. Configure the application further and hack away.
